Allright now you can deploy cuteblog website on static cloud hosting, for first you can build on production mode so run with `jekyll build` and you can see _site folder. yes.. you just need to push _site folder to static hosting , so you can use firebase or surge.

Or you can push your sourcecode web on github repo, create account on github - create new repo - then register on netlify or heroku / vercel etc, create new project and integration your project with github repo and deploy it.

congratulations now you have successfully to deploy cuteblog jekyll.
